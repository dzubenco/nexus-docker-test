# nexus-docker-test
Test repository for nexus lessons




# Prerequisite steps:
* Rocky Linux 8

# Installation steps:
## 1. Install Sonatype Nexus 3 repo and Nexus 3 itself

following the steps from https://github.com/sonatype-nexus-community/nexus-repository-installer#yum-setup

## 2. Fine-tune the memory requirements

by editing the file `/opt/sonatype/nexus3/bin/nexus.vmoptions` (for weaker systems set

```
-Xms512m
-Xmx512m
-XX:MaxDirectMemorySize=512m
```

## 3. Enable and start Nexus 3 service

via `sudo systemctl enable nexus-repository-manager --now`

## 4. Login to Nexus as `admin`.

To ensure the system begins with a secure state, Nexus Repository Manager generates a unique random password during the systemâ€™s initial startup which it writes to the data directory (in our case it's "sonatype-work/nexus3") in a file called admin.password.

So you can use the value from this file:

`sudo cat /opt/sonatype/sonatype-work/nexus3/admin.password`

And then go to http://your_host:8081/ in your browser to log in as "admin" user using the password from the file above.
